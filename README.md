# 🧭 Dijkstra Pathfinding & Graph Tools Web App

An interactive **web application** to build, edit, and visualize graphs with support for the **Dijkstra Algorithm**, **Critical Path Analysis**, and **Graph Matrices**. Designed for learning, teaching, and experimenting with graph theory and pathfinding.

## 🎮 Key Features

- 🧠 Visualize **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (Shortest Path)
- 🟥 Visualize **Critical Path** (Longest Duration Path)
- 🔢 Generate and view **Adjacency** and **Incidence Matrices**
- 🧩 Full Graph Editing: Add/remove nodes and edges
- 🌀 Import/export graphs (JSON), export graph as PNG image
- 🎲 Generate random graphs
- 🔄 Modify graph elements with mouse interaction

## 📋 Usage Instructions

- **Add Node:** Click "Add Node" and enter a name and duration.
- **Delete Node:** Click "Delete Node" and enter the node name.
- **Add Edge:** Click "Add Edge" and enter origin, destination, and cost. Choose if it should be **bidirectional**.
- **Delete Edge:** Click "Delete Edge" and enter origin and destination.
- **Edit Node/Edge:** Click on any node or edge to modify its label, duration (nodes), or cost (edges).
- **Interaction:** Move nodes with your mouse. Zoom using the scroll wheel.
- **Add Random Graph:** Click "Add Random Graph" and input the number of nodes.
- **Delete All:** Click "Delete All" to reset the graph.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Click "Dijkstra Algorithm", select start and end nodes. The **shortest path** will be highlighted in **green**.
- **Critical Path:** Click "Critical Path", enter start and end nodes. The **longest path** will be highlighted in **red**.
- **Export Graph:** Download the current graph as a `.json` file.
- **Import Graph:** Load a `.json` file to restore a saved graph.
- **Export Image:** Save a **PNG image** of the current graph view.
